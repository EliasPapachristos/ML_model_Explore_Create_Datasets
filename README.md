# ML_model_Explore_Create_Datasets
In this notebook, we will explore data corresponding to taxi rides in New York City to build a Machine Learning model in support of a fare-estimation tool. The idea is to suggest a likely fare to taxi riders so that they are not surprised, and so that they can protest if the charge is much higher than expected.
